# Backlog, known limitations and decisions

Things both agents and the crew should be able to find without reading chat logs. Add to
this file whenever a review defers something, or a decision is made that no other doc
records. Roadmap: [`ROADMAP.md`](ROADMAP.md). Design:
[`superpowers/specs/2026-10-28-cafetycoon-design.md`](superpowers/specs/2026-10-28-cafetycoon-design.md).

## Deferred review items

Found by the fresh-context reviews of phases 1a and 1b and judged Minor: real, but not
worth a fix before the first game night. Fix one when touching its area, or when a
playtest complains about it.

### From phase 1a (solo café)
- Cards bought during the night are not written to the saved snapshot right away, so a
  refresh in the middle of the night may not restore a just-bought card.
- A gamble card's outcome is never shown to the player; it only shows up in the numbers.
- A speed modifier reads as "+100% faster" where "twice as fast" is meant.
- Pressing Space while a button has keyboard focus both activates the button and interacts
  in the café.
- The settings store generates a fresh random token on every read when none is saved.
- The notice shown when a run is discarded is generic and doesn't say what was lost.
- Run history leaves out one-day ad items.
- One Review Focus case from the 1a plan (item 2) has no step-level test.

### From phase 1b (peer-to-peer co-op)
- A peer that rejoins with a different token over the same connection never sends a leave
  for its old token, so the old barista lingers until the host resumes.
- The per-tab identity fallback for browsers that block storage is unreachable; with
  storage blocked, identity resets on refresh.
- Sending to a peer that just left logs an unhandled promise rejection in the console.
- The host logs nothing when a friend's join fails.
- Closing the tab (as opposed to refreshing) loses both the barista and the Rejoin offer.
  The README tells players to keep playing in the same tab.

## Known limitations, accepted for now
- Peers draw the latest host snapshot directly, with no interpolation buffer, so a jittery
  connection shows jittery movement.
- No player cap and no input rate limit on the host.
- Player tokens travel inside snapshots, so a friend in the room could impersonate another
  player. Fine among friends; not fine for strangers.
- No TURN fallback. If two homes can't connect directly, the fix is the Cloudflare relay
  described in design spec §10.
- The browser console shows a failing connection to one public Nostr relay
  (relay.flashapp.me). Expected noise; the other relays carry the room.

## Decisions not recorded elsewhere
- 2026-10-28: Telemetry is a phase 2 goal. The roadmap rewrite had dropped it; Kennedy wants
  it. Host-recorded, downloaded as a file, no new accounts; see design spec §13.
- 2026-10-28: Saves and unlocks carried between game nights are a nice-to-have, not phase 1;
  they stay in phase 3.
- 2026-10-28: Where AI keys live (the host's browser, or a small backend) is decided in
  phase 5, not before. The design spec's default is the host's browser; the roadmap lists a
  backend as an option.
- 2026-10-28: `main` stays the stable, playable build; finished phases get git tags. No
  versioned paths.
- 2026-10-28: Ownership split, recorded in [`UI_OVERHAUL.md`](UI_OVERHAUL.md): the Video
  Game Designer agent owns `src/ui/*` and the title wiring in `src/main.ts`; Claude owns
  `src/sim`, `src/net`, `src/host`, `src/storage` and the phase 2 bots.
- Pull requests and code review start when someone other than Kennedy contributes. Until
  then both agents push straight to `main` once tests and the build pass.
